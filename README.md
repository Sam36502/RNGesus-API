# RNGesus-API

One day, whilst at work, I was inspired to create the
holiest of random number generators which would allow
programmers to let God gently guide their systems.

## Features
The RNG is actually just the default Golang RNG, but it's
seeded using The Hand of Godâ„¢, this means that, if he so desires,
God can change how your program runs to his whims. (Loosely
based on the genius works of Terry A. Davis.)

Of course, God is also attentive to our interests and so
you can pray to increase the likelihood of a specific
number arising. Of course, regular prayer is likely to be
drowned out by the unwashed masses, so we offer our customers
a prime service: we ~~bribed~~ hired a small monastery in
Jerusalem to all pray for whatever numbers you send them, so
by using the `/pray` endpoints, your prayers will be amplified.

## Usage
### Server / API

To host your own instance of the RNGesus API, you can either
build it, use the provided linux binary (sorry, windows users)
or run the docker container. (Public hosted example in progress)

The endpoints are as follows:

#### Endpoints

**`/v1/rand/float`:**
Generates and returns a random 64-bit floating point number

Params:
 - None

Response:

    {
        "num": 0.0000000000000000
    }

**`/v1/rand/int:`**
Generates and returns a random 64-bit integer

Params:
 - `min` (optional) Minimum allowed number
 - `max` (optional) Maximum allowed number

Response:

    {
        "num": 0
    }

**`/v1/pray/float:`**
Prays a certain number will show up more frequently

Params:
 - `num` (required) What float to pray for

Response:

    {
        "msg": "The monks are praying hard for '0.00000', Amen."
    }

#### Error Response
If an error occurs, it will return with status `666` and a message
object with some information about the error e.g.:

    {
        "msg": "Error: Invalid `num` parameter ('not-a-number') provided: strconv.ParseFloat: parsing \"not-a-number\": invalid syntax"
    }

### Client
I've also included a basic client into this repository for use in go.
Simply...

    go get github.com/Sam36502/RNGesus-API

... and then import "github.com/Sam36502/RNGesus-API/client"

Then you can create an `RNGesusClient`

```go
    package main

    import "github.com/Sam36502/RNGesus-API/client"

    func main() {
        rng := client.RNGesusClient{
            BaseUrl: "localhost:777",
        }
        fmt.Println("A random number granted by God himself:", rng.GetRandomFloat())
    }
```
